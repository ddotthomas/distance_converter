# distance_converter

A Distance converter I wrote while learning Rust

It takes input either passed to it from standard input (stdin)

or from the command line after running the program


Will convert Miles and Kilometers from one another and also Feet to Meters

Label the input with Mi, Km, Ft, and M (case insensitive)


To build for yourself make sure you have Rust and cargo installed, then run

`cargo build --release`

Your executable will be in ./target/release/, I recommend moving it to your ~/.local/bin/ folder
